Crowd LDAP Server
=================

This project is an LDAP server implementation based on the Apache Directory Server. It allows authentication and
authorization by delegating queries to an Atlassian Crowd installation using the Crowd REST-API.

### How to start

This project depends on the sbt build tool and the Java SE Development Kit version 8.

For starting the server the backend and server configuration files should be edited.

* etc/backend.properties (Crowd)
* etc/server.properties (LDAP server)
* etc/log4j.properties (Logging)

To run the server after configuration, simply run the following command:

	sbt run

Alternatively, the server can be run in a Docker container.

    make build
    make push
    
    docker run \
      --detach \
      --net=host \
      --name crowd-ldap-server \
      --env "CROWD_APP_NAME=crowd-openid-server" \
      --env "CROWD_APP_PASSWORD=password" \
      --env "CROWD_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8095/crowd/services/" \
      --env "SERVER_BIND_ADDRESS=localhost:10389" \
      aservo/crowd-ldap-server:latest

An overview of all configuration keys can be found in the file "start.sh". To ensure that the boot process was
successful, the following command can be used:

    docker logs crowd-ldap-server

For detailed information about configuration keys read the comments in configuration files.
